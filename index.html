  <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
  <img src="images/pamssquash.jpg" alt="Picture of me holding squash" />
  <p>My name is Dylan Baltrus and this is my fourth year at IIT. I'm studying cybersecurity and cyber forensics here, and am enrolled in the co-terminal program. 
    I am originally from Long Island, New York, but I've moved out here and live pretty close to IIT's campus. I love to play basketball, train boxing, 
	and otherwise stay active. My previous experience with web development includes taking ITMD 361 and 362 with Dan Krieglstein at IIT.</p>
	<p> I aim to learn more about how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive web pages, and learn more about the different technologies interacting
	to make our modern web pages work the way they do.</p>
	<p>After I graduate, I'm unsure exactly what I would like to do with my degree, but I believe that at some point I would like to use my knowledge to engage in
	some sort of criminal investigations at some point. I've always thought that would be very interesting.</p>
